## Project Overview
The project involves the application of machine learning techniques, specifically clustering and principal component analysis (PCA), to a dataset. The tasks include cleaning and preprocessing the data, implementing K-Means and Hierarchical clustering methods, and determining the optimal number of clusters. Additionally, PCA is used to reduce the dataset to its principal components for visualization and analysis.

## Data Processing
- Importing Libraries and Dataset: Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn were used for data manipulation and modeling. The dataset was loaded and basic exploratory data analysis was performed.
- Data Cleaning: Missing values were identified and handled. Non-numeric columns were encoded for clustering analysis.
- Standardization: Features were standardized to ensure that each feature contributes equally to the distance calculations in clustering.
-  Clustering Implementation: Both K-Means and Hierarchical clustering were applied. The Elbow method and Silhouette scores were used to find the optimal number of clusters.
- PCA: The dataset was reduced to two principal components, and a scatter plot was created to visualize the clusters.


## Model Used
- K-Means Clustering: This algorithm partitions the dataset into K distinct clusters based on feature similarities. The optimal number of clusters is determined using the Elbow method.
- Hierarchical Clustering: This method builds a hierarchy of clusters and was used to supplement the K-Means results. The optimal number of clusters was also validated using Silhouette scores.

## Key Insights
- Data Preparation: Standardizing data is essential for accurate clustering. Handling missing values and ensuring the dataset is clean improves model performance.
- Optimal Clustering: The Elbow method and Silhouette scores are effective for determining the optimal number of clusters. For this dataset, both methods suggested 3 as the optimal number of clusters.
- PCA Visualization: Reducing dimensions with PCA helps in visualizing the separation of clusters, providing a clearer understanding of the data structure.

## Conclusion 
the project showcases the power of clustering and PCA in extracting meaningful patterns and reducing dimensionality for better data visualization. The methodologies and findings provide a solid foundation for further exploration and application of these techniques in various domains.
